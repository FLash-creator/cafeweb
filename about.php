        Our Cafe10 is not like any other cafe becuse other cafe give Beveragses but we give Beveragses along with love. Our 
  Cafe is established at 2nd August in 2017, this cafe is run by MOMIN'S & MAHTA'S.When your looking into weather you want your child should eat food from home or the cafeteria, or whether they should pack lunches from home, there are lots of things to consider. While considering these options, I learned those lunches that are packed from home are much better for the child. School lunches are expensive, and home lunches are healthier. Also, home lunches teach children about being responsible and it teaches them how to take care of themselves. Thse thing are important because they have long lasting effects. The first thing that parents look at when they buy lunches for their children is how much lunches cost.

      Foods bought from a school cafeteria also cause a lot of weight problems. These foods are not well balanced, and often include unhealthy deserts, and snack. Obesity is the number one cause for heart problems in America, so we should try to encourage the children to make healthy choices, and pack lunches from home. Another reason to pack lunches from home, is that children these days tend to be picky eaters. If a child doesn’t like what is served, then they wont eat it. Student who don’t eat full lunches are shown to do poorly on test, and have trouble studying. Food is a very important part of a person’s day, and if they don’t get enough of it, it can affect their mood, and behaviors. Children aremore likely to eat foods that they have picked out by themselves, as long as they approved by the parents as healthy foods. Many children today go home and have ‘snacks’. Most of the time, this can pretty much turn out to be an entire bag of potato chips, or two or three glasses of milk. Although these foods can be good for you, they aren’t supposed to be eaten like that. If children eat a full meal for lunch that day, they won’t feel the need to eat so much for a snack. Another way that home lunches can be better for children is that they teach children the importance of self responsibility. Packing them alone can teach kids what kind of foods are good for there bodies.
